This project is a website that I made to show the different web applications I
have developed. It's like a collection of my work that demonstrates my skills
in creating websites and web applications. In my project, you can see different
types of web technologies that I have used, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I have also used different frameworks that help me create web applications more efficiently.
